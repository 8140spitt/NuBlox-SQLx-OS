## Best Practices

1. **Test in Staging First**
   - Always test playbooks in non-production first
   - Document any deviations from expected behavior

2. **Use Checklists**
   - Track completion of each step
   - Mark any skipped or modified steps

3. **Document Deviations**
   - If you deviate from the playbook, document why
   - Update playbook if deviation becomes standard

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - After each execution, note improvements
   - Update playbooks based on learnings

5. **Version Control**
   - Keep playbooks in git
   - Review changes like code

## Automation Opportunities

Identify steps that can be automated:
- Repetitive tasks
- Error-prone manual steps
- Time-consuming procedures

Create automation scripts in `/scripts` directory and reference them in playbooks.
