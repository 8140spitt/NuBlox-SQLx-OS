# SQLx Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan v4.0  
*Continuity, Replication, and Failover Strategy for the SQLx Operating System*  
**Version:** 4.0 **Status:** Stable **Owner:** NuBlox Labs — SRE, Compliance, and Continuity Engineering  

---

## Executive Summary  
The SQLx OS Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan defines the policies, technical procedures, and automated workflows that ensure **business continuity**, **data durability**, and **regulatory compliance** in the event of system or regional failure.  
It aligns with the Runbook, Security, and Observability frameworks to deliver measurable **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)** and **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)** under a zero-trust, AI-assisted architecture.

---

## 1  Objectives  

| Goal | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Continuity** | Maintain platform availability and tenant access during failures. |
| **Integrity** | Ensure zero data corruption or policy loss post-recovery. |
| **Compliance** | Demonstrate adherence to GDPR/SOC2/HIPAA business continuity clauses. |
| **Automation** | Enable Copilot-driven and Kernel-assisted DR orchestration. |
| **Transparency** | Provide verifiable, timestamped audit evidence of all recovery actions. |

---

## 2  Recovery Definitions  

| Term | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** | Max acceptable data loss window. |
| **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** | Max acceptable downtime before full service restoration. |
| **Warm Site** | Continuously replicated environment, minimal manual intervention. |
| **Cold Site** | Infrastructure provisioned on demand, backup restoration required. |
| **Hot Site** | Fully active-active replication with automatic failover. |

    end

* **Replication Layer:** WAL-based streaming for databases; Kafka topic mirroring for telemetry.
* **Orchestration:** Copilot + Kernel DR controller monitors health probes.
* **Failover Logic:** automatic promotion if primary health check < SLO for 3 consecutive minutes.

## 4  RTO / RPO Targets

| Tier       | Use Case                  | RPO      | RTO      | Mode |
| :--------- | :------------------------ | :------- | :------- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | Kernel + Metadata DB      | ≤ 30 sec | ≤ 2 min  | Hot  |
| **Tier 2** | Telemetry & Policy Stores | ≤ 2 min  | ≤ 5 min  | Warm |
| **Tier 3** | AI Fabric Models          | ≤ 15 min | ≤ 15 min | Warm |
| **Tier 4** | Archive & Analytics       | ≤ 4 h    | ≤ 12 h   | Cold |

Targets reviewed quarterly and verified via DR drills.

## 5  Data Replication Strategy

| Component                   | Mechanism                               | Notes                                   |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Databases**               | WAL streaming + snapshot sync           | Transaction-consistent checkpoints      |
| **Object Storage**          | Cross-region replication (S3/GCS/Azure) | Versioned buckets, 7-year retention     |
| **Telemetry Streams**       | Kafka MirrorMaker 2 / Redpanda Mirror   | Topic partition parity maintained       |
| **Audit Ledger**            | Append-only chain                       | Periodic notarisation; immutable replay |
| **Configuration & Secrets** | Encrypted backup via HSM export         | Rotation enforced after restore         |

## 6  Failover & Restoration

### 6.1  Automated Failover Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant MON as Health Monitor
    participant COP as Copilot
    participant KRN as Kernel DR Controller
    participant SEC as Security Ledger

    MON->>COP: Health degradation alert
    COP->>KRN: Trigger failover decision
    alt quorum >= 2
        KRN->>KRN: Promote standby cluster
        KRN->>SEC: Record signed promotion event
        COP->>OBS: Update routing + notify tenants
    else
        COP->>OPS: Manual confirmation required
    end
```

**Failback** occurs after 24 h stability window or manual validation.

### 6.2  Manual Restoration Steps

1. Validate object store integrity (`sha256sum` comparison).
2. Re-hydrate databases from encrypted snapshots.
3. Re-register policy and AIR caches.
4. Sync audit ledger entries since last checkpoint.
5. Re-enable Copilot reinforcement loops.

## 7  Backup Policy

| Type                 | Frequency | Retention | Encryption          |
| :------------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :------------------ |
| Incremental WAL      | 5 min     | 7 days    | AES-256-GCM         |
| Full Snapshot        | 24 h      | 30 days   | AES-256-GCM         |
| Compliance Ledger    | 12 h      | 7 years   | SHA-256 + Signature |
| AI Model Checkpoints | 1 h       | 90 days   | Signed, versioned   |
| Config / Secrets     | On change | 90 days   | HSM-sealed exports  |

Backups verified nightly via checksum diff and sandbox restore tests.

---

## 11  Security Integration

* All DR actions signed and chained to **audit ledger**.
* **mTLS** enforced between regions.
* **Token scopes:** `dr.initiate`, `dr.restore`, `dr.readonly`.
* **Copilot Verification:** ensures privacy budgets and PII policies remain intact.

---

## 12  Cost & Efficiency Optimisation

* **Tiered storage** for cold archives (Glacier / Deep Archive).
* **Deduplicated Parquet compression** for telemetry backups.
* **Copilot forecasting** to predict replica utilisation and optimise cost.
* **Auto-decommission** idle warm replicas after 72 h stability.

---

## 13  Metrics & SLIs

| Metric                     | Target   | Notes                  |
| :------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------- |
| Backup success rate        | ≥ 99.9 % | validated via checksum |
| Failover detection latency | < 60 s   | monitoring response    |
| Recovery verification time | < 5 min  | automated validation   |
| RPO compliance ratio       | ≥ 99 %   | across all tenants     |
| DR test pass rate          | ≥ 95 %   | rolling average        |

---

## 14  Continuous Improvement

* Post-test results automatically ingested by Copilot for reinforcement.
* RPO/RTO targets recalibrated based on SLO drift.
* Documentation diffed with last version and committed to `/docs/ops/disaster/`.
* Quarterly joint review by SRE + Security + Compliance.

---

## 15  Open Questions (RFCs)

1. Should Copilot dynamically select **replication mode** (async vs sync) per workload class?
2. Should DR evidence packs integrate directly with **RegOps Studio** dashboards?
3. Could **predictive fault injection** simulate DR events for model training?
4. Should we expose **tenant-level DR dashboards** in SQLx Studio Enterprise?
5. Should cryptographic signatures move to **post-quantum algorithms** by v5?
