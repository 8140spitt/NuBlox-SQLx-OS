# SQLx Runbook and Incident Playbook v4.0  
*Operational Response, Recovery, and Continuity Framework for SQLx OS*  
**Version:** 4.0 **Status:** Stable **Owner:** NuBlox Labs — Operations & SRE Division  

---

## Executive Summary  
This Runbook and Incident Playbook defines the **operational procedures** for detecting, diagnosing, mitigating, and documenting incidents within the SQLx OS platform.  
It provides a unified, automation-first framework integrating **Observability**, **Security**, and **AI Copilot** for rapid, policy-compliant response and continuous resilience improvement.  
All steps herein are executed via **Kernel APIs**, **Telemetry signals**, and **AIF auto-mitigation hooks**.

## 3  Incident Classification

| Severity  | Impact                              | Examples                          | Initial Response Time | Escalation                    |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **SEV-1** | System-wide outage or data loss     | Kernel crash, driver auth failure | < 5 min               | Immediate on-call             |
| **SEV-2** | Service degradation, partial outage | Slow queries, PPC regression      | < 15 min              | SRE + Copilot auto-mitigation |
| **SEV-3** | Non-critical fault, single tenant   | Policy denial spike, log overflow | < 1 h                 | Ops review                    |
| **SEV-4** | Cosmetic or tooling issue           | Dashboard latency, doc errors     | < 24 h                | Scheduled fix                 |

## 6  Common Playbooks

### 6.1  Driver Connection Failures

**Symptoms:** spike in `sqlx_driver_errors_total`, auth timeouts.
**Actions:**

1. Copilot retries handshake with exponential backoff.
2. Verify TLS cert validity and endpoint reachability.
3. Rotate credentials via Kernel API.
4. If persistent, failover to replica region.
5. Record `driver.connect.error` span and mark resolved.

---

### 6.2  Query Latency Regression

**Symptoms:** p95 latency breach for class L/B/A.
**Actions:**

1. Copilot inspects `sqlx_exec_latency_ms` histograms.
2. Trigger PPC plan re-evaluation; invalidate slow plans.
3. If regression persists, scale connection pools and cache TTL.
4. Generate “Plan Regression” RCA report.

---

### 6.3  Policy Denial Surge

**Symptoms:** sudden increase in `sqlx_policy_denies_total`.
**Actions:**

1. Verify policy version → ensure latest signed pack loaded.
2. Copilot analyses denial reasons; suggests rule tuning.
3. If misconfiguration, rollback to prior policy revision.
4. Log `policy.rollback.ok` event.

---

### 6.4  Telemetry Export Failure

**Symptoms:** exporter errors > 0.5 %.
**Actions:**

1. Restart OTLP collector.
2. Validate endpoint and credentials.
3. Enable temporary file buffering.
4. If prolonged, switch to secondary collector cluster.

---

### 6.5  Security Breach / Suspicious Activity

**Symptoms:** repeated auth failures, anomaly detection trigger.
**Actions:**

1. Contain affected workspace; revoke all tokens.
2. Rotate HSM keys; isolate Kernel nodes.
3. Audit recent `sqlx_security_*` metrics.
4. Export incident ledger snapshot for compliance.
5. Initiate SEV-1 escalation and notify Security Team.

---

### 6.6  Migration Failure

**Symptoms:** `ddl.migration.error`, rollback triggered.
**Actions:**

1. Inspect migration ledger for failure context.
2. Validate schema consistency between source/target.
3. Execute auto-rollback via Migration Engine.
4. Generate signed RCA with evidence export.

## 10  Documentation & Evidence

All incidents must generate:

* **Incident Record** (JSON, signed)
* **RCA Report** (Markdown + PDF export)
* **Evidence Pack** (telemetry snapshots, policy pack, ledger diff)
* **Follow-Up Actions** (GitHub issue links or change requests)

Stored under `/var/sqlx/incidents/{year}/{incident_id}/`.

---

## 11  Continuous Improvement

* Copilot consumes post-incident RCA data to retrain reward models.
* Kernel updates its mitigation heuristics.
* Observability adjusts thresholds and dynamic baselines.
* Runbooks versioned; diffs tracked in GitHub for audit.

## 12  Performance Targets

| Metric                          | Target   | Notes         |
| :------------------------------ | :------- | :------------ |
| MTTA (mean time to acknowledge) | < 5 min  | SEV-1         |
| MTTR (mean time to resolve)     | < 30 min | SEV-1         |
| Auto-Mitigation Success         | ≥ 80 %   | SEV-2 class   |
| RCA Completion                  | < 24 h   | All incidents |
| Runbook Drift                   | ≤ 10 %   | Monthly audit |

---

## 13  Open Questions (RFCs)

1. Should Copilot autonomously escalate based on **anomaly severity score**?
2. Can ATS schema extensions carry **incident context metadata** for correlation?
3. Should post-incident RCAs feed directly into AI training pipelines?
4. Can Runbooks be rendered dynamically inside SQLx Studio dashboards?
5. Should the next release adopt **“Ops-as-Code”** policy packs (YAML DSL)?
