# SQLx Operational Readiness Checklist v4.0  
*Pre-Deployment, Upgrade, and Business-Continuity Validation Framework*  
**Version:** 4.0 **Status:** Stable **Owner:** NuBlox Labs — Operations, SRE & Compliance  

---

## Executive Summary  
The SQLx Operational Readiness Checklist (ORC) defines the minimum verifications required before any release, migration, or regional activation of SQLx OS.  
It enforces reliability, compliance, and security conformance across the Kernel, AI Fabric, Observability, and DR subsystems.  
Every section must be completed, signed, and versioned prior to GA or patch rollout.

---

## 1  Overview  

| Objective | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Reliability Assurance** | Validate health, failover, and SLO compliance pre-release. |
| **Security Posture** | Verify key rotation, TLS enforcement, and policy integrity. |
| **Compliance** | Confirm GDPR/SOC2/SOX audit artifacts and retention schedules. |
| **Observability** | Ensure complete traceability and telemetry ingestion. |
| **Disaster Preparedness** | Test DR failover and data-integrity recovery. |

## 3  Post-Deployment Validation  

| # | Category | Check | Status | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | **Telemetry** | 100 % of services reporting metrics/traces/logs. | ☐ |  |
| 2 | **Latency** | p95 exec latency ≤ SLO target (L/B/A/S classes). | ☐ |  |
| 3 | **Error Rates** | Driver/Kernel errors ≤ 0.1 % baseline. | ☐ |  |
| 4 | **Policy Compliance** | No unauthorized denials; π hash unchanged. | ☐ |  |
| 5 | **DR Validation** | Replication lag < 30 s; standby health OK. | ☐ |  |
| 6 | **AI Feedback** | Reward loop active; confidence ≥ 0.9. | ☐ |  |
| 7 | **Security Telemetry** | Zero invalid signatures; zero TLS warnings. | ☐ |  |
| 8 | **Ledger Integrity** | Audit entries append-only verified. | ☐ |  |

## 7  Sign-off Workflow  

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    OPS[Ops Lead] --> SEC[Security Officer]
    SEC --> COM[Compliance Officer]
    COM --> ENG[Engineering Director]
    ENG --> REL[Release Manager]
````

* **Ops Lead:** confirms operational & observability readiness.
* **Security Officer:** validates all cryptographic checks and keys.
* **Compliance Officer:** verifies evidence and retention.
* **Engineering Director:** approves release freeze or rollback.
* **Release Manager:** executes deployment.

Each sign-off produces a signed `release-approval.json` entry in `/release/approvals/`.

---

## 8  Automation Integration

* **Copilot Hooks** — auto-evaluate readiness metrics and pre-populate checklist.
* **GitHub Actions** — run YAML validation and sign-off gating.
* **Slack Bot / CLI** — `/sqlx readiness status` → returns live completion rate.
* **Telemetry Correlation** — readiness data logged to ATS for trend analysis.

## 10  Open Questions (RFCs)

1. Should readiness checks integrate directly into **SQLx Studio CI dashboards**?
2. Should the checklist be version-controlled and signed automatically by CI?
3. Can Copilot forecast readiness drift based on telemetry trends?
4. Should readiness incorporate **energy/cost efficiency metrics**?
5. Should future releases enforce “green readiness” thresholds for sustainability KPIs?
