# SQLx Copilot Architecture v1.0  
*Autonomous Intelligence for Database Design, Optimization, and Compliance*  
**Version:** 1.0 **Status:** Active Implementation under `@nublox/sqlx-ai`

---

## 1. Executive Summary  
SQLx Copilot represents the cognitive layer of the NuBlox SQLx Operating System.  
It is an embedded artificial intelligence engine that observes, learns, and guides every aspect of database operation—from query formulation and schema planning to performance tuning, security enforcement, and compliance auditing.  
Unlike traditional assistants or ORMs, Copilot operates natively within the SQLx runtime, executing in real time as a trusted orchestration subsystem rather than an external tool.

Its mission is to make the database **self-designing, self-optimizing, and self-governing**.  
This is achieved through continuous introspection, adaptive reasoning, and closed-loop feedback based on telemetry emitted by the SQLx Kernel and Gateway.

---

## 2. Purpose and Objectives  
The Copilot layer serves five primary objectives:

1. **Intelligent Planning** — Understand the structure and semantics of data models to propose optimal schema designs.  
2. **Query Optimization** — Rewrite, reorder, or parameterize SQL dynamically based on real-time workload patterns.  
3. **Policy Enforcement** — Translate organizational and regulatory policies into executable rules within the SQLx Policy Graph.  
4. **Autonomous Remediation** — Detect performance regressions or policy violations and trigger corrective actions.  
5. **Continuous Learning** — Train and fine-tune internal models using historical telemetry and developer interaction data.

---

## 3. Architectural Overview  
Copilot consists of four major subsystems tightly integrated with the SQLx runtime:

- **Planner Core:** A semantic engine that parses metadata, foreign-key relationships, and access patterns to generate schema blueprints and migration suggestions.  
- **Optimizer Engine:** A reinforcement-learning component that experiments with alternative query plans, indexes, and cache strategies to reduce cost and latency.  
- **Policy AI Agent:** Encodes compliance frameworks such as GDPR and SOX into executable logic. It can both audit existing schemas and synthesize new compliant configurations.  
- **Orchestrator Hub:** A runtime bridge linking Copilot decisions to external modules such as the API Gateway, Kernel, and Observability layer.

Each subsystem runs as a deterministic, sandboxed worker so that recommendations never alter live data without explicit commit or policy approval.

---

## 4. Cognitive Data Flow  
Telemetry from the SQLx Kernel and Gateway is streamed into Copilot’s ingestion buffer.  
This includes SQL statements, execution metrics, error codes, and access context.  
The Planner Core uses this information to infer schema patterns and detect inefficiencies.  
The Optimizer Engine simulates hypothetical indexes and query plans in memory, using the cost-based models derived from live traces.  
Results are then published back to the Gateway through the **AI Orchestrator Interface**, where human or automated approval determines deployment.

This feedback loop forms the **Autonomous SQLx Learning Cycle**, continuously improving performance and compliance fidelity without manual tuning.

---

## 5. Integration with the SQLx Gateway  
Every API request entering the SQLx Gateway can be intercepted by Copilot through three integration hooks:

1. **Pre-Resolve Hook** — Analyse intent and suggest or apply semantic corrections before execution.  
2. **Post-Resolve Hook** — Record actual cost and result metadata for learning and regression analysis.  
3. **Policy-Violation Hook** — Trigger real-time interventions when detected actions breach compliance rules.

Through these hooks, Copilot becomes a transparent intelligence layer that augments rather than replaces developer control.

---

## 6. Model Architecture and Learning  
The AI architecture combines deterministic symbolic reasoning with probabilistic models.

- **Symbolic Layer:** Implements SQL grammar parsing, schema diffing, and dependency graph traversal in pure TypeScript.  
- **Probabilistic Layer:** Employs fine-tuned lightweight transformer models trained on anonymized telemetry to predict optimal execution patterns and recommend indexes or schema reorganizations.  
- **Reinforcement Layer:** Uses real execution results as feedback to reward or penalize optimisation strategies, converging toward minimal cost plans.

Copilot’s models are modular; each workspace maintains its own adaptive weights that reflect its data domain and usage style, ensuring privacy and contextual relevance.

---

## 7. Schema Planning and Migration Guidance  
During database evolution, Copilot can automatically generate migration plans by comparing introspected live schemas with declared targets.  
It validates foreign-key dependencies, recommends normalization adjustments, and generates human-readable migration scripts.  
This capability transforms SQLx into a **living schema engineer**, able to evolve structures continuously while preserving referential integrity.

---

## 8. Policy and Compliance Intelligence  
The Policy AI Agent within Copilot integrates directly with the Compliance and Security layers.  
It parses organizational directives into executable rules stored in the Policy Graph.  
Examples include data-retention timeouts, encryption requirements, and access constraints.  
When a new schema or query violates these rules, Copilot either blocks the action or rewrites it to conform automatically.  
All such actions are logged for audit with full traceability.

---

## 9. Telemetry and Explainability  
Every decision made by Copilot is recorded with a trace identifier and a structured explanation packet.  
This ensures human interpretability of AI-driven behaviour.  
Developers can query these records through the Observability interface to see why a query was rewritten, what alternative plans were tested, and what policy reasoning applied.  
Explainability is a core design requirement to ensure trust and compliance across enterprise deployments.

---

## 10. Security and Data Isolation  
Copilot never accesses raw data directly; it operates on metadata and anonymized aggregates derived from the Kernel’s telemetry.  
All training processes occur within the workspace boundary.  
No cross-tenant data sharing is permitted.  
Weights and models can be exported or deleted under administrative control to meet right-to-erasure requirements.

---

## 11. Interaction Modes  
Copilot can operate in three distinct modes depending on deployment context:

- **Advisory Mode:** Generates recommendations without executing changes; ideal for development environments.  
- **Collaborative Mode:** Works interactively with developers inside SQLx Studio, offering in-line prompts and code generation.  
- **Autonomous Mode:** Executes optimisations and policy enforcement automatically under enterprise governance approval.

Mode transitions are governed by configuration profiles and compliance settings.

---

## 12. Deployment and Configuration  
Copilot runs as an internal service of the SQLx runtime.  
Its configuration defines model registry paths, telemetry sinks, learning rates, and policy graphs.  
Administrators can enable or disable specific agents (Planner, Optimizer, Policy) individually to fit workload needs.  
For offline or embedded deployments, pre-trained weights are bundled with the SQLx distribution to allow inference without network access.

---

## 13. Ethical and Governance Considerations  
As an autonomous decision-making engine, Copilot adheres to NuBlox’s AI Ethics Charter.  
This mandates transparency, human override at all decision points, reproducibility of learning outcomes, and alignment with data protection laws.  
Audit logs and model versions are retained to ensure that any AI-generated decision can be reproduced or rolled back.

---

## 14. Future Development Roadmap  
Planned enhancements for versions 2.0 and beyond include:

- Multi-agent collaboration between Planner, Optimizer, and Policy units using shared reinforcement signals.  
- Natural-language to SQL translation directly embedded in Studio editors.  
- Contextual dataset summarisation and automatic documentation generation.  
- Continuous verification pipelines integrating with CI/CD systems.  
- Federated learning across isolated workspaces to share general performance insights without sharing raw data.
