# SQLx SRE Policies and Runbook v1.0  
*Operational Reliability, Resilience, and Auto-Remediation Framework for the NuBlox SQLx OS*  
**Version:** 1.0 **Status:** Stable **Owner:** NuBlox Labs — SRE & Operations  

---

## Executive Summary  
The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) framework in NuBlox SQLx OS defines how the autonomous database maintains service health, prevents outages, and recovers from unexpected states.  
It codifies operational discipline into reproducible automation so that the platform can respond faster than any human while still preserving full auditability.  
This document describes the reliability policies, incident workflows, and runbook automation used by SQLx OS to achieve self-healing behaviour across distributed environments.

## Purpose and Scope  
The SRE layer ensures that reliability is not an afterthought but an intrinsic property of the system.  
Its policies govern error budgets, deployment gates, scaling behaviour, and remediation triggers.  
Every policy is machine-readable, version-controlled, and enforced by the runtime itself.  
Through integration with Observability, AI Copilot, and the Policy Graph, SRE becomes both the custodian of uptime and the guardian of compliance.

## Philosophy of Operation  
SQLx SRE follows three principles:

1. **Automation over heroics:** anything that can be scripted should be.  
2. **Observability-driven action:** nothing happens without data; metrics guide all responses.  
3. **Human-in-the-loop learning:** the system repairs itself but always leaves a transparent trail for engineers to review and refine.

These principles allow SQLx to achieve enterprise-grade reliability while operating autonomously in hybrid or multi-tenant environments.

## Reliability Policy Model  
Each workspace defines a reliability policy expressed in declarative YAML.  
Policies specify service-level objectives, escalation thresholds, and the actions to take when deviations occur.  
A simplified example reads:

```yaml
reliability:
  slo_targets:
    availability: 99.95%
    latency_p95_ms: 150
  error_budget_thresholds:
    warn: 50%
    critical: 80%
  escalation_chain:
    - notify: sre@workspace
    - trigger: copilot.auto_remediate
