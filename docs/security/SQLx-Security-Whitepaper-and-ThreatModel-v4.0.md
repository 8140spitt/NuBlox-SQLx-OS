# SQLx Security Whitepaper and Threat Model v4.0  
*Comprehensive Security Architecture, Threat Surfaces, and Mitigation Strategy for the SQLx Operating System*  
**Version:** 4.0 **Status:** Stable **Owner:** NuBlox Labs — Security & Compliance Division  

---

## Executive Summary  
Security in SQLx OS is engineered as a **deterministic and auditable control plane**, not an afterthought.  
This document defines the threat model, cryptographic baseline, RBAC/ABAC model, and end-to-end protections that ensure SQLx remains a **zero-trust, policy-driven, privacy-preserving** platform across all deployments — from single developer nodes to enterprise clusters.  

---

## 1  Core Security Principles  

| Principle | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Zero Trust by Default** | Every connection, process, and API call must authenticate and be policy-authorized. |
| **Defense in Depth** | Multiple layers — network, kernel, policy, telemetry, AI. |
| **Least Privilege** | Scopes and roles are minimal, explicit, and time-bound. |
| **Immutable Audit** | Every sensitive event produces a signed, tamper-evident ledger entry. |
| **Privacy by Design** | PII never leaves its residency zone unredacted or unapproved. |
| **Deterministic Builds** | Reproducible binaries, SBOMs, and verified supply chain. |
| **Explainable Enforcement** | Every denial or obligation must be trace-linked to policy evidence. |

**Protection Domains**

1. **Network Plane** — TLS 1.3+ encryption, mTLS for internal services.
2. **Kernel Plane** — sandboxed processes, memory scrubbing, and policy isolation.
3. **Data Plane** — encrypted storage (AES-256-GCM) and signed migration ledgers.
4. **AI Plane** — differential privacy budgets, signed model artefacts, redacted training data.

## 3  Authentication & Identity

| Component            | Mechanism                                | Description                                         |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Human Users**      | OIDC / OAuth2                            | Integrates with enterprise SSO; short-lived tokens. |
| **Service Accounts** | JWT + Mutual TLS                         | Cryptographically bound to tenant + workspace.      |
| **Drivers**          | Ephemeral key exchange                   | Derived during TLS handshake; no static secrets.    |
| **AI Fabric Agents** | Scoped tokens (`aif.manage`, `aif.read`) | Restricted to telemetry ingestion/feedback.         |

**Session Lifecycle**

1. Token issued by Auth Service (5–15 min lifetime).
2. mTLS handshake binds token → session key.
3. Policy Graph evaluates scope + role.
4. Renewal requires re-authentication; no silent refresh beyond 1 h.

---

## 4  Authorization Model (π: Policy Graph)

SQLx unifies **RBAC**, **ABAC**, and **PBAC** (policy-based access control) under a graph model.

| Layer    | Example                                  | Description                                    |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **RBAC** | `role:data.steward`                      | Hierarchical roles assigned to users/services. |
| **ABAC** | `region=eu`, `sensitivity=pii`           | Attribute-driven conditions on context.        |
| **PBAC** | `deny if crossRegion && sensitivity=pii` | Executable policy expressions.                 |

Policies are versioned, digitally signed, and enforced at the **Kernel boundary** before driver execution.
All decisions emit `policy.decision` telemetry to the ATS schema.

## 5  Data Protection

### 5.1  Encryption Standards

| Context         | Algorithm                               | Key Length | Notes                              |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :--------- | :--------------------------------- |
| TLS Channels    | TLS 1.3 AES-256-GCM / ChaCha20-Poly1305 | 256 bit    | Forward secrecy via ECDHE.         |
| Storage at Rest | AES-256-GCM                             | 256 bit    | Envelope encryption using KMS/HSM. |
| API Tokens      | Ed25519 signatures                      | 256 bit    | Stateless verification.            |
| Hashing         | SHA-256 / BLAKE3                        | —          | Deterministic IDs and artefacts.   |

### 5.2  Secrets Management

* All secrets stored in OS keychain or HSM (HashiCorp Vault / AWS KMS).
* No plain-text credentials persisted beyond runtime memory.
* Rotations enforced automatically (`rotateCredentials()` in Kernel API).

| Supply Chain  | Package compromise   | Low        | High   | SBOM, signature verification, reproducible builds |

## 7  AI & Telemetry Security

* **Differential Privacy (DP)** budgets enforce epsilon-delta limits on federated learning.
* **Signed Model Artefacts:** each Copilot model includes hash + metadata → verified on load.
* **Telemetry Integrity:** SHA-256 on ATS payloads; signatures verified in Collector.
* **Reward Validation:** rejects out-of-range or inconsistent latency samples.
* **Access Control:** telemetry ingestion allowed only from whitelisted Kernel nodes.

## 8  Compliance Framework Alignment

| Regulation / Standard | SQLx Compliance Mechanisms                                        |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GDPR / UK DPA**     | Residency tags, right-to-erase hooks, consent flags in ATS.       |
| **SOC 2 Type II**     | Continuous telemetry + audit ledgers, separation of duties.       |
| **HIPAA**             | PHI classification tags, encrypted channels, audit log retention. |
| **SOX**               | Immutable migration ledger + policy approval workflows.           |
| **ISO 27001**         | Comprehensive ISMS coverage; documented SLOs/Security controls.   |

Evidence exports are generated via the Compliance Studio (JSON / CSV / PDF).

## 9  Logging, Audit, and Ledger

### 9.1  Structured Audit Log

Every privileged or data-modifying action emits a signed log event.

```json
{
  "ts": "2025-10-17T09:30:00Z",
  "actor": "user:admin-1",
  "action": "kernel.migration.apply",
  "resource": "schema:api.users",
  "policy_id": "pol:9f3a",
  "decision": "allow",
  "signature": "ed25519:4a1b..."
}
```

### 9.2  Immutable Ledger

Append-only table: `sqlx_audit_ledger`

* Each record SHA-256 chained to previous hash.
* Periodic notarisation into object storage or blockchain anchor (optional).
* Retention: ≥ 7 years (configurable).

## 10  Security Telemetry

Integrated with Observability layer (see SLO spec).

| Metric                                   | Description                |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| `sqlx_security_auth_failures_total`      | Authentication failures    |
| `sqlx_security_tls_handshakes_total`     | Successful mTLS handshakes |
| `sqlx_security_policy_denies_total`      | Enforcement count          |
| `sqlx_security_model_signatures_invalid` | Rejected AI artefacts      |

All metrics exported via OTLP with privacy-safe tags only.

---

## 11  Incident Response Workflow

1. **Detect** — alert via Observability thresholds or anomaly detection.
2. **Contain** — isolate compromised workspace or tenant.
3. **Eradicate** — revoke tokens, rotate keys, patch.
4. **Recover** — validate integrity via audit ledger.
5. **Post-Mortem** — generate signed IR report within 72 h.

**Runbooks:** stored under `/docs/ops/runbooks/SQLx-Runbook-and-IncidentPlaybook-v4.0.md`.

---

## 12  Penetration & Fuzz Testing

* Automated fuzzing of drivers, parsers, and packet decoders.
* Quarterly third-party penetration testing (web/API/kernel planes).
* Continuous mutation testing for policy enforcement code paths.
* Test coverage ≥ 95 % for security-critical modules.

---

## 13  Supply Chain & Build Integrity

* **SBOM** generated for every release (`/release/sbom.json`).
* **Reproducible builds** verified by hash equivalence.
* **Signature Verification**: all dependencies must be GPG-signed.
* **CI/CD Hardening**: isolated runners, no shared credentials, ephemeral tokens.

## 14  Performance & Overhead Targets

| Security Function       | Target Overhead |
| :---------------------- | :-------------- |
| TLS handshake latency   | < 20 ms         |
| Auth token verification | < 2 ms          |
| Policy evaluation       | < 1 ms          |
| Audit log write         | < 5 ms          |
| Encryption CPU overhead | < 5 %           |

---

## 15  Open Questions (RFCs)

1. Should SQLx enforce **hardware-rooted attestation** for Kernel nodes (TPM/TEE)?
2. Should the ledger anchor integrate with a **public blockchain notariser**?
3. Can Copilot leverage anomaly scores for automated incident triage?
4. Should telemetry encryption adopt **post-quantum primitives** (Kyber/Dilithium)?
5. How to extend zero-trust boundaries into client SDKs?
