Perfect — we’re officially moving from whitepaper to **build mode**. 👷‍♂️

Here’s how I propose we phase the *development* based on the architecture already outlined:

---

## 🚀 **Phase 1: Core Foundation (0–4 weeks)**

Focus: make `@nublox/sqlx` runnable end-to-end with dialect discovery and basic CLI.

### ✅ Milestones

* [ ] Implement **core driver handshake layer** (MySQL + Postgres).
* [ ] Build **Feature Learner** (capability probe → JSON feature map).
* [ ] Create **IR engine** (schema, ops, diff).
* [ ] Wire up CLI commands: `ping`, `learn`, `snapshot:pull`, `plan:diff`, `apply`.
* [ ] Add unit tests for connection handling, timeout recovery, and probe correctness.

### 💡 Deliverable

A working `nublox-sqlx` CLI that can **learn** any SQL server’s dialect and **generate** a schema diff plan.

---

## ⚙️ **Phase 2: DDL + DML + TCL Engine (4–8 weeks)**

Focus: make NuBlox SQLx capable of doing *everything a DBA can do* — schema, data, and transactions.

### ✅ Milestones

* [ ] Expand IR for DDL (schema/table/index/view/trigger).
* [ ] Implement **DML engine** for inserts, updates, upserts (dialect-free).
* [ ] Add **TCL controller** for nested transactions and savepoints.
* [ ] Prototype **AI optimizer hooks** (telemetry + feedback loop).
* [ ] Integrate **snapshot diff + plan:apply** with rollback and audit log.

### 💡 Deliverable

NuBlox SQLx becomes a true **schema + data management engine**, ready for alpha benchmarks.

---

## 📊 **Phase 3: Cache, Telemetry & Health (8–12 weeks)**

Focus: performance and observability.

* [ ] Build **L1/L2 cache system** (in-memory + Redis optional).
* [ ] Integrate telemetry (latency, throughput, error, slow query ML).
* [ ] Add **Health Monitor & Circuit Breaker** with auto-reconnect and failover logic.
* [ ] Implement first **Prometheus/OpenTelemetry exporter**.
* [ ] Wire data to “AI Advisor” scaffolding.

---

## 🧠 **Phase 4: AI, DQL Optimizer & Security (12–20 weeks)**

Focus: intelligence and enterprise readiness.

* [ ] Implement **Adaptive Query Optimizer**.
* [ ] Add **DCL security framework** (RBAC, row/column policies).
* [ ] Integrate compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 templates).
* [ ] Launch **Copilot module** for natural-language DBA operations.
* [ ] Build minimal **NuBlox Cloud Control Plane** for multi-tenant telemetry.

---

## 🌍 **Phase 5: Cloud & OEM Release (20–32 weeks)**

Focus: scaling and partnership readiness.

* [ ] Container-native deployment, REST API, SDK for Node/Python/Go.
* [ ] High-availability orchestration (leader election, replication sync).
* [ ] OEM packaging for MySQL/Postgres integrations.
* [ ] Public benchmarks and whitepaper v2 for investors.
