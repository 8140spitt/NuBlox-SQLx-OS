# Product_Vision_NuBlox_SQLx_OS_v4.2.md

## Vision
Build the **Database OS that thinks**: one runtime that **learns** any SQL engine and one **IDE** that covers design, code, operate, observe, and govern—without dialect silos.

## What’s uniquely NuBlox
- **Dialect‑agnostic** via WireVM + wire packs.
- **Self‑learning** server & database profiles persisted in Studio schema.
- **Autonomous planning** with online‑safe strategies.
- **Security & compliance** as first‑class policy modes.
- **NuBlox Copilot** grounded in IR + capabilities.

## Users & outcomes
- DBAs, backend, data/platform engineers.
- Replace 10–12 tools with **SQLx OS + Studio**.
- 3–4× dev velocity; downtime −90% target; ~65% OPEX reduction.

## Experience highlights
- Studio tree: Connection → Databases → Tables/Views/Indexes.
- Learn flow persists **capability_json** (server) and **profile_json** (per DB).
- Planner proposes/validates/applies online plans with rollback.
- Observability and governance integrated (health, executions, analytics, audit).

## Commercial model
- Signup at **nublox.io** → `user.nublox.io` workspace.
- Plans: Free / Pro / Enterprise; Studio desktop licensed by workspace.
- OEM in 2027 roadmap.

## Roadmap
- **Q4’25 (Alpha)**: MySQL/MariaDB; Studio alpha; Cloud GA for connections/profiles.
- **2026**: Postgres family; compliance GA; advanced Copilot; marketplace seeds.
- **2027**: OEM + “default DB OS”.
